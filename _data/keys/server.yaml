- key: pg.connect
  description: >
    Monitor the availability of a PostgreSQL server. Returns 1 if the Zabbix Agent
    can connect to a PostgreSQL database with the specified connection string.

    If you are using connection pooling, the connection string specified in
    this key should bypass your pooling agent to better reflect the
    availability of your PostgreSQL server. All other keys can be safely
    rerouted through a pooling agent.

    1: Success

- key: pg.setting.discovery
  description: >
    Returns a JSON array of all known settings available for monitoring.

    This key is useful for monitoring changes to all configuration values if
    needed. The more recommended practice however, is to manually define keys
    in your template for settings that are important to you which may then also
    be used in composite graphs, triggers, etc.

    Returns the value of the specified run-time configuration setting. This key is

    The return type is determined by the PostgreSQL `vartype` of the requested
    setting.

  description: >
    Returns the percentage of time spent writing or syncing checkpoints since

    Ideally, this should return the percentage of time spent checkpointing
    since the server started, but unfortunately statistics are not reset when
    the server restarts. Please just note that server uptime will influence
    the results (e.g. if the server has been down 50% since it last reset
    statistics, it will appear it spent 50% less time writing checkpoints).
